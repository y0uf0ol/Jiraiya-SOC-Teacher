If you are not in my SOC you probably won't find this super helpful but use it anyway :)

# Week 1
Bone dry Theory
This will suck but, will help us both in the long run.

**Basic Security Refresher:**

[Professor Messer Sec+ Guide](https://www.professormesser.com/security-plus/sy0-601/sy0-601-video/sy0-601-comptia-security-plus-course/ "Professor Messer Sec+ Guide")

This is a good refresher in all the Security related Topics that will potential pop up. And as a bonus, it will prepare you very well for the Exam too.

And don' get this wrong, you don't have to finsish this in week 1, watch it through the weeks progress. 

**Refresher on Defender**

[Defender for Endpoint Ninja Training](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-defender-for-endpoint/become-a-microsoft-defender-for-endpoint-ninja/ba-p/1515647#_Toc45281200 "Defender for Endpoint Ninja Training")

Security Operations Fundamentals is important for us to start. Work through it and learn it to love, you will spend a good amount of time in that portal :)

Key Points for the first week:
- get started and get comfortable
- checkout the the team :)
- refresh or learn a thing or two with the provided content
- and be excited for week 2
