If you are not in my SOC you probably won't find this super helpful but use it anyway :)

# This is Work in progress

# Week 1
Bone dry Theory
This will suck but, will help us both in the long run.

**Basic Security Refresher:**

[Professor Messer Sec+ Guide](https://www.professormesser.com/security-plus/sy0-601/sy0-601-video/sy0-601-comptia-security-plus-course/ "Professor Messer Sec+ Guide")

This is a good refresher in all the Security related Topics that will potential pop up. And as a bonus, it will prepare you very well for the Exam too.
And don't get this wrong, you don't have to finsish this in week 1, watch it through the weeks progress.
